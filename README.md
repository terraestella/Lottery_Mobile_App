**Showcase:** probability, factorials, sampling without replacement

This project is about programming functions that could be incoroprate into a mobile app which would enable its users to estimate their chances of winning the 6/49 lottery.

The goal is to build functions that anser various probability questions, such as:
- what is the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?
- what is the probability of winning the big prize if we play 40 different tickets  (or any other number)?
- What is the probability of having at least five (or four, or three, or two) winning numbers on a single ticket?
